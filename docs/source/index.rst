===============================================
 *PyBERT* Source Code Developer's Guide v2.4.1
===============================================

Welcome to the *PyBERT Developer's Guide*!
==========================================

Note to PyBERT *users*
----------------------

The documentation for the *PyBERT* project has 2 parts:

* help for stand-alone GUI application *users*, and
* help for PyBERT *developers* and *importers*

This is the help for developers and importers.

If you're looking for usage instructions, you're in the wrong place.
Instead, try:

* Looking at the *Help* tab of the PyBERT GUI.
* Looking at the `PyBERT FAQ <https://github.com/capn-freako/PyBERT/wiki/pybert_faq>`_.
* Sending me e-mail at: <capn.freako@gmail.com>.

Note to PyBERT *importers*
--------------------------

If you are importing PyBERT functionality into a larger body of work, this *is* the right place for you, since it provides:

- module, class, and attribute definitions and specifications of intent, and
- calling signatures for module/class member functions.

Acknowledgments
---------------

I would like to thank the following individuals for their contributions to the *PyBERT* project:

**Mark Marlett** for first introducing me to Python/NumPy/SciPy, as an
alternative to MATLAB for numerical computing and signal processing, as
well as his countless hours of tutelage, regarding the finer points of
serial communication link simulation technique. Mark is also the one,
whom insisted that I take a break from development and finally write
some documentation, so that others could understand what I intended and,
hopefully, contribute. Thanks, Mark!

**Low Kian Seong** for straightening out my understanding of the real
purpose of the *description* field in the *setup.py* script.
